    "Udacity partnered with Starbucks to provide a real-world business problem and simulated data mimicking their customer behavior. This project is focused on tailoring the personalized offers sent as part of the Starbucks Rewards Program to the customers who are most likely to use them. The Machine Learning terminology for this is \"propensity modeling\".\n",
